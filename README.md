# AI Recruitment Notes

This repository contains practical, systems-level notes on how AI is
changing recruitment, hiring workflows, and talent evaluation.

The focus is on real-world implementation rather than theory or hype.

## Core Themes

- Autonomous AI agents in hiring
- AI-led interviews and evaluation
- Skills-based hiring over CV screening
- Human-in-the-loop system design
- Scaling recruitment without scaling headcount

## Key Observations

### AI Is a Workflow, Not a Feature
Successful AI recruitment systems automate entire workflows rather than
adding isolated AI tools to existing processes.

### CVs Are a Weak Signal
Resume keyword matching introduces noise and bias.
Skills-based evaluation and structured interviews produce more reliable
signals.

### Interviews Are the Bottleneck
First-round interviews are repetitive, inconsistent, and difficult to
scale. AI-led interviews standardize evaluation while preserving fairness.

### Autonomy Requires Oversight
Fully autonomous hiring is neither realistic nor desirable.
Human-in-the-loop designs balance scale with accountability.

## Where AI Works Best in Hiring

- High-volume hiring
- Early-stage screening and interviews
- Skills verification
- Candidate ranking and prioritization

## What AI Should Not Replace

- Final hiring decisions
- Cultural judgment
- Accountability and ownership
